# Documentation Writing

::: important
Documentation writing should comply with MarkdownLint standards. Please refer to [MarkdownLint Rules](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint/blob/master/docs/RULES.md). You can use the [VSCode Plugin](https://github.com/DavidAnson/vscode-markdownlint) to assist in writing.
:::

## Alert Containers

M9A documentation is built with [VuePress Theme Plume](https://theme-plume.vuejs.press/), which supports rich Markdown extension syntax.

Use container syntax (`::: type` format) to create alert boxes:

::: note
This is a note box
:::

::: info
This is an info box
:::

::: tip
This is a tip box
:::

::: warning
This is a warning box
:::

::: caution
This is a danger warning box
:::

::: details
This is a collapsible details box
:::

### Custom Titles

You can add custom titles after the container type:

```markdown
::: tip Quick Tip
This is the tip content
:::

::: warning Important Notice
Please pay attention to this important warning
:::
```

::: tip
Nested containers may not render correctly. It's recommended to avoid using multiple levels of nesting.
:::

## Images

To add images to the documentation, follow these steps:

1. Upload the image to the public repository [M9A-WEB](https://github.com/MAA1999/M9A-WEB/tree/main/docs/.vuepress/public/images)
    - Place the image in the corresponding subdirectory (e.g., `docs/.vuepress/public/images/develop/`)
    - Use clear, descriptive names with lowercase letters and hyphens (e.g., `pipeline-flow.png`)

2. Construct the image URL path
    - Formula: `/images/[subdirectory]/[filename]`
    - Example: Upload to `public/images/zh-cn/newbie-init-script-step2.webp`, URL is `/images/zh-cn/newbie-init-script-step2.webp`

3. Insert the image using Markdown syntax in the documentation

```markdown
![Newbie init script step 2](/images/zh-cn/newbie-init-script-step2.webp)
```

::: tip

- PNG or WebP format is recommended for better display quality
- Keep image size under 500KB when possible
- Add meaningful alt text (description) to improve accessibility

:::

## Code Blocks

### Basic Code Blocks

Use three backticks to wrap code and specify the language:

````markdown
```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
````

### Code Block Features

Supports the following enhanced features:

- **Line Numbers**: Enabled by default
- **Line Highlighting**: Add `{line}` or `{line-range}` after language identifier
- **Filename Display**: Add `:filename` after language identifier

Example:

````markdown
```python:example.py {2,4-6}
def hello():
    name = "World"  # highlighted
    message = f"Hello, {name}!"
    print(message)  # highlighted
    print("Done")  # highlighted
    return message  # highlighted
```
````

## Tabs

Use tabs to organize multiple solutions or code examples:

::: tabs
@tab Solution 1
This is content for solution 1

@tab Solution 2
This is content for solution 2

@tab Code Example

```python
print("Example code")
```

:::

You can nest code blocks, images, and other markdown elements inside tabs as shown above.

## File Tree

Display project directory structure:

```markdown
::: file-tree

- docs/
    - zh_cn/
        - develop/
            - pipeline.md
            - custom.md
    - en_us/
        - develop/
            - pipeline.md
            - custom.md
